# Flight-Management
The project is a web-based flight booking management system developed using Flask, a Python web framework. It allows users, including booking agents and passengers, to interact with the system. Agents can add new flight bookings on behalf of passengers, and passengers can view their bookings. The system includes features like storing passenger and agent information, flight details, and managing booking transactions. SQL is used for database operations, and Flask-Login ensures secure authentication. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing flight reservations and enhancing the overall booking experience.
